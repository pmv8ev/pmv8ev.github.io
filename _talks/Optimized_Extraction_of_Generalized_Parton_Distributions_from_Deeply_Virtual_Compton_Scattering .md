Generalized Parton Distributions (GPDs) are a powerful tool that allows greater insight into the internal structure of the nucleon. GPDs define the matrix elements for the deeply virtual Compton scattering (DVCS) process. I will first present a spectator model calculation for the quark, anti-quark and gluon chiral even GPDs H,E,H˜,E˜ in terms of the kinematic variables X, ζ, and t. The model implements the polynomiality and positivity constraints, and it is evolved in perturbative QCD up to next to leading order. I will then illustrate the implementation of computer tensor algebra methods to construct algorithms to optimize the analysis for DVCS, Bethe Heitler, and interference cross-section terms for various beam and target polarization.
