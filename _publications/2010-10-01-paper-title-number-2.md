Let A(ℓ,n,k) denote the number of ℓ-tuples of commuting permutations of n elements whose permutation action results in exactly k orbits or connected components. We provide a new proof of an explicit formula for A(ℓ,n,k) which is essentially due to Bryan and Fulman, in their work on orbifold higher equivariant Euler characteristics. Our proof is self-contained, elementary, and relies on the construction of an explicit bijection, in order to perform the ℓ+1→ℓ reduction. We also investigate a conjecture by the first author, regarding the log-concavity of A(ℓ,n,k) with respect to k. The conjecture generalizes a previous one by Heim and Neuhauser related to the Nekrasov-Okounkov formula.
