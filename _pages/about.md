Hello! 

I am current first year graduate student at Pennsylvania State University! My research interests include Scattering Amplitudes for Quantum Field Theories and their machine learning implementations. I am affiliated with the Institute for Gravitation and the Cosmos here at Penn State under my advisor Professor Jacob Bourjaily. 

My (research) story so far: 
======
I started my research life at the University of Virginia under Professor Simonetta Luiti, studying the Generalized Parton Distributions in nucleons. My work with her group culiminated with a (paper)[https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.01826] on parameterization of Generalized Parton Distributions. While attending the (Transverse Momentum Distribution Winter School)[https://newmexicoconsortium.org/2022-tmd-winter-school/], I was lucky enough to talk with Professor Zhongbo Kang about our shared interest in 

 I was introduced to machine learning through numerous converations with graduate students at UCLA after I spent a summer there working with Zhongbo Kang and Farid Salazar on Effective Field Theories . This led me to pursue a Fulbright fellowship in Heidelberg, Germany under Professor Tilman Plehn studying and applying bayesian neural networks to LHC data[]. Now I am a first year graduate student at Pennsylvania State University, looking to my time here in State College! I am starting this website as a first year as a way to document some of the cool things that I read and projects that I code up.
