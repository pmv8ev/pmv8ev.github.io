Hello! 

My name is Philip Velie and I am current first year graduate student at Pennsylvania State University! My research interests include Scattering Amplitudes for Quantum Field Theories and their machine learning implementations. I am affiliated with the Institute for Gravitation and the Cosmos here at Penn State under my advisor Professor Jacob Bourjaily. 

My (research) story so far: 
======
I started my research life at the University of Virginia under Professor Simonetta Luiti, studying the Generalized Parton Distributions in nucleons. I was introduced to machine learning through numerous converations with graduate students at UCLA after I spent a summer there working with Zhongbo Kang and Farid Salazar. This led me to pursue a Fulbright fellowship in Heidelberg, Germany under Professor Tilman Plehn.
